# Pyre (gusty repo) — Roadmap

This file is the living, concrete plan for building and evolving **Pyre** (the
`gusty` repo), a Python-like language whose core is compiled ahead-of-time
through LLVM. It lives next to `AGENTS.md` and is the single source of truth
for *what exists*, *what is next*, and *what is gap-shaped*.

> Status snapshot (verified against the code, 2026): version `0.10.0`
> (`pkg/lang/compile.go`). ADRs run `0001`..`0160`.

## Roadmap — phased plan

### Phase 0 — hygiene
- Version reconciled (v0.10.0 in `compile.go`, printed by CLI). ✅ DONE
- **New**: renumber the duplicated ADR `0143` (standalone-type-check) to `0152`;
  the file header and roadmap snapshot/component-map references now all say
  `0152`. ✅ DONE

### Phase 1 — AOT/interpreter parity
- Floats in AOT ✅ DONE — codegen emits real `double` IR (`fadd double 0.0, <const>`),
  float arithmetic with `sitofp` promotion, `%.17g` float print matching interpreter
  `%v`, `fcmp` float comparisons, and `double` allocas/stores tracked via `floatVars`;
  `float()` folds int/string literals to double constants.
- Runtime heap + GC in AOT (milestone 1..11) ✅ DONE — boxed mutable lists with
  `list.append()` on variables + `print(list)`, `len(x)` on runtime list vars,
  `x[i]` index read, free-list slot reuse on rebind, free on rebind-to-non-list,
  variable-index reads `x[a]`, runtime heap dicts, runtime heap sets,
  cross-collection rebind free, heap-stress/leak harness, heap bounds safety
  (`rt_alloc` -1 sentinel), conservative mark-and-sweep GC, closure env slots
  rooted across top-level GC boundaries. ✅ DONE

### Phase 2 — language surface
- Gradual typing (`--verify` checks assignment annotations) ✅ DONE
- Comprehensions (list/dict/set) ✅ DONE
- Slicing (`s[a:b]`, `s[::step]`, negative indices) ✅ DONE — interpreter + codegen
  (string *variables* limited to inline literals in AOT; see gap below)
- Augmented assignment (`+= -= *= /= //= %=`) ✅ DONE
- Tuple unpacking / multi-assign (`a, b = b, a`, `for a, b in ...`) ✅ DONE
- Membership + identity ops (`in`/`not in`, `is`/`is not` via `rt_contains`) ✅ DONE
- Power `**` (right-assoc binop; `math.Pow`/binary-exponentiation; `@llvm.pow.f64` in AOT) ✅ DONE
- Pattern-match depth: guards (`case x if cond:`), or-patterns (`case 1 | 2:`),
  dict patterns (`case {"k": v}:`) ✅ DONE (interpreter; AOT is expression-equality only — see gap)
- Class patterns (`case Point(x, y):` with subclass walk + aliases) ✅ DONE (interpreter-only; see gap)
- Operator overloading / dunder dispatch ✅ DONE (interpreter; AOT static-dispatch only — see gap)
- `with` / context managers + `yield from` ✅ DONE (interpreter; AOT emits protocol/loop but runtime blocked — see gap)
- f-strings (`f"..."` / `f'...'` with `{}` interpolation) ✅ DONE
- Docstrings + `__doc__` ✅ DONE (interpreter; AOT `__doc__` interpreter-only — see gap)
- FFI / `extern fn` → C calls ✅ DONE
- On-disk stdlib modules (`math`, `string`, `collections`, `json` — folded as AOT constants) ✅ DONE

### Phase 3 — tooling
- CLI pipeline (eval | codegen → `llc` → `cc`) ✅ DONE
- Multi-file build ✅ DONE
- Source maps + DWARF debug info ✅ DONE
- Standalone type-check mode (`gusty check`) ✅ DONE
- Canonical formatter (`gusty fmt`) ✅ DONE
- LSP server (stdio; hover, completion, diagnostics) ✅ DONE
- `--json` schema for AST/IR dumps ✅ DONE
- Seeded property/fuzz testing across both backends ✅ DONE

## Current gap-shaped work (fill before new features)

These are the *known* parity/robustness gaps — the next planned items, in
priority order. Each ships with a unit test + an `integration/` compile-and-run
case (and an ADR where the decision is non-obvious).

### Gap A — AOT dynamic-dispatch correctness (ADR 0151)
- **Status**: ✅ DONE — variable slots holding instance handles are registered
  as GC roots on every assignment form (single, augmented, tuple, loop,
  params), and the GC transitively marks reachable heap data (lists/dicts/
  instances), so a polymorphic receiver that survives many real GC
  collections + slot reuse dispatches on the *live* instance. All call sites,
  including expression-level `v.speak()` in function bodies and
  `make(1).speak()`, emit the runtime class-id dispatch switch.
- Verified: `dispatch_gc_stress.gy` conformance case allocates two receivers
  (Animal + Dog), then forces the 1024-slot heap to fill/free/reuse repeatedly
  (2000 throwaway lists), then dispatches on both — parity 43 (1+42),
  interpreter == AOT. Also `dispatch_gc.gy` (receiver survives later
  allocation) and `dispatch_nested.gy` (expression-level receiver in a
  function body).
- DoD: parity program dispatches identically on interpreter + AOT + JIT. ✅

### Gap B — AOT match / pattern exhaustiveness
- **Status**: 🟢 MOSTLY DONE — AOT `match` now lowers list-destructuring patterns (`[a, b]`), dict patterns (`{k: v}`), and class patterns (`Point(x, y)` with subclass-walk + attribute binding) to runtime IR via `rt_list_len`/`rt_get_elem`, `rt_dict_has`/`rt_dict_get`, and `rt_heap_kind`/`rt_inst_get`. Guards, `_`, and or-patterns already lower. Remaining: class-pattern aliases (`Alias = Point`) and bare-name binding edge cases.
- Port interpreter pattern semantics to codegen: guards, or-patterns, dict
  patterns, class patterns (subclass walk + attribute binding).
- ✅ DONE (Round 13): bare-name capture binding (`case x:`) now works in both
  backends — the interpreter binds the subject to the name and always matches,
  and codegen emits a fresh variable-slot store instead of comparing against a
  non-existent variable. Locked in by `match_test.go` unit tests
  (`TestMatchBareNameCapture*`) and the `match_baren` conformance program
  (23/23 conformance cases parity).
- **New**: exhaustiveness / irrefutability checking in `semantic.go` — a
  `match` over an `int`/enum-like subject with a `case _:` is exhaustive; a
  non-exhaustive `match` is a warning (mypy-style) and a definite-assignment
  analysis proves which bindings are definitely assigned after the `match`.
- DoD: every interpreter `match` case also lowers to AOT; a
  `match_exhaustive` integration program runs identically on both backends.

### Gap C — arbitrary (fnptr-valued) decorators
- **Status**: ✅ DONE — the canonical wrapping decorator
  (`def dec(g): def wrap(x): return g(x)+1; return wrap`) compiles and runs in
  AOT via compile-time specialization (`@f_orig` + `@f_impl` + funcBind).
- Add fnptr operands and indirect `call` lowering to codegen (`closure.go`),
  then support `@dec` where `dec(f)` returns a transformed function value.
- DoD: `@dec @dec2 def f` with wrapping decorators runs identically on both
  backends.

### Gap D — AOT `with` / `yield from` runtime (ADR 0140)
- **Status**: ✅ DONE (Round 17) — `with`/`yield from` pass AOT/interpreter parity.
- Round 17 root cause: generator accumulator lists (`genHandle`) were not GC-rooted, so the GC at body-statement boundaries collected/reused them; `yield from` then read a stale handle (double-appends, wrong sums). Fix: root each generator's `genHandle` and the `yield from` sub-list in rooted alloca slots; list-literal `yield from` now unrolls instead of treating a global as a heap handle. Regression tests: `TestParityYieldFromAcrossGC`, `TestParityYieldFromLiteral`.
  a runtime yield-from loop, but execution is blocked by a pre-existing
  duplicate-function defect (ADR 0140).
- Fix the duplicate-function lowering so the emitted protocol/loop actually
  runs; add parity programs for `with expr as name` + `yield from`.
- DoD: `with` and `yield from` integration programs run on AOT, byte-identical
  to the interpreter.

### Gap E — AOT float/`__doc__`/string-slicing leftovers
- **Status**: ✅ mostly DONE, small leftovers.
- `float()`/`round()`/`int()` paths now emit real `double` IR: the semantic
  analyzer recognizes the conversion builtins (`float`, `round`, `int`, `str`,
  `chr`, `ord`) so they pass `verify`/`--jit`, and the AOT codegen emits a
  real `double` for a general `float(x)` argument (via `floatValue`, which
  `sitofp`-converts ints and passes through floats). Parity test:
  `TestParityConversionBuiltins`. ✅ DONE.
  (`codegen.go:4449`) should emit real `double` IR.
- `__doc__` reads are interpreter-only: emit the folded docstring constant in AOT. ✅ DONE — `def.__doc__`/`Cls.__doc__` now folds to a string constant in the AOT backend (see `case *Attr:` in `value()` + `stringVal()`), with a JIT unit test (`TestJITDocstrings`) and an integration parity test (`TestParityDocstrings`).
- String slicing in AOT is limited to inline literals; support string *variable*
  slicing by lowering to the runtime `rt_slice` helper.
- DoD: no `interpreter-only` branch remains in codegen for a tested feature.

### Gap F — AOT operator overloading (dunder dispatch)
- **Status**: ✅ DONE (Round 16)
- `emitDunderBinOp` in codegen.go lowers a BinOp with a statically-known class
  operand to a direct call to the class's dunder (`__add__`/`__mul__`/`__lt__`…)
  or reflected (`__radd__`/`__rmul__`/swapped comparisons) method, mirroring
  jit.go's `evalBinOp` dispatch order (left dunder first, then reflected right).
- Falls back to builtin arithmetic/comparison when no overloading applies.
- Conformance program `integration/programs/dunder.gy` covers left/reflected
  dispatch, `__lt__` comparisons, and non-instance fallback; interp==AOT.
- Limitation: AOT dispatch is static (varClasses/receiverClass), so dunder only
  fires on operands known to be instances at compile time (direct `Vec()`
  assignment or `self` in a class body), matching the existing static-method AOT.

### Gap G — AOT `in`/`not in` on inline literal containers
- **Status**: ✅ DONE (ADR 0156) — literal list/set/dict membership is unrolled
  to `l == elem` comparisons against the constant integer elements/keys
  (dict tests keys), empty literals fold, `not in` inverts.
- DoD: `TestParityLiteralMembership` — `x in [1,2,3]`, `x not in [1,2,3]`, `x in {1,2,3}`, dict-key `in`, and empty-container `in`/`not in` all match the interpreter on AOT.

- **Gap H — LLVM `opt` pipeline** — ✅ DONE — real `opt` is invoked when installed
  (`runLLVMopt`); the deterministic textual fallback (`optimizeTextual`) runs
  const-fold, promote (mem2reg), deadHeapElim, scalarRepl (SROA), dead-block,
  and dead-global passes.
- **SROA follow-on** — ✅ DONE — `scalarRepl` promotes a non-escaping heap list
  object whose every element access uses a constant index to registers: each
  `rt_get_elem(h, N)` is rewritten to the value the most recent
  `rt_set_elem(h, N, v)` stored, and the `rt_alloc` + all `rt_set_elem` are
  deleted. It fires only within a single basic block (program order makes the
  stored value unambiguous) and skips escaping objects, appends, and reads of
  unwritten indices.

- **Gap I.1 — AOT heap containers across function boundaries** — ✅ DONE
  (ADR 0161). A list/dict/set is an i32 handle into the runtime heap; getting
  one through a call boundary needed both halves fixed, and each had a
  different failure mode:
  - *call site*: a container literal was lowered to its compile-time global and
    passed as `i32` (`call i32 @total(i32 @.lst1)`), which `llc-20` rejects with
    "global variable reference must have pointer type". Literal arguments are
    now materialised with `rt_alloc`/`rt_set_elem`/`rt_set_add`/`rt_dict_put`
    and passed by handle — including globals produced by constant-folded
    comprehensions.
  - *callee*: a parameter was an unknown-shape integer, so `for x in xs`
    silently compiled into a `0..handle` range loop (wrong answers, no error).
    A whole-module inference (`pkg/lang/heapargs.go`) now types each parameter
    as list/dict/set from its annotation, its default, or any call site —
    propagated to a fixed point so forwarding calls
    (`def doubled(xs): return total(xs)`) work — and the body uses
    `rt_list_len`/`rt_get_elem`/`rt_dict_get` accordingly.
  Covered by `pkg/lang/heapargs_test.go`, `integration/heap_args_test.go`, and
  the `programs/heap_containers.gy` conformance case (interpreter/AOT stdout
diff
  asserted in the matrix).

- **Gap I.3 — assigned containers are heap handles (AOT)** — ✅ DONE (ADR 0163).
  The same class of bug at the *binding* site, all three surfaced by the L8.2 module
  verifier: assigning a constant-folded comprehension emitted `store i32 @.lst1, i32*
  %_ys` (rejected by LLVM) and printed an address; module-level `xs = []` left the
  variable without a slot, so `xs.append(i)` referenced an undefined `%_xs` and `rt_gc`
  could not see the handle; and `funcDef`'s per-body state leaked into `main`, letting a
  parameter's alloca be reused by module code. Assignments now materialise folded lists
  (`rt_alloc`/`rt_set_elem`), module definitions allocate + root their slot, module code
  starts a fresh binding scope, and the parameter-kind fixed point merges in sorted order
  (determinism). Covered by `programs/folded_lists.gy` plus unit/integration cases.
- **Gap I.2 — strings inside runtime containers (AOT)** — 🟥 FOUND
  The heap stores i32 slots, so a `list[str]`/`dict[str, int]` element cannot
  hold an `i8*` string global (`rt_set_elem(i32 %h, i32 1, i32 @.str1)`). The
  compiler now *reports* this instead of emitting unverifiable IR:
  `codegen: strings inside runtime containers are not supported by the AOT
  backend yet (the interpreter supports them)`, surfaced as
  `{"ok": false, "phase": "compile", ...}` under `--emit-llvm --json`.
  Remaining work: a string heap kind (interned `i8*` table + a tag), after which
  these shapes join the conformance matrix.
  Note: `Callable` parameters called through the parameter (`def apply(f, x):
  return f(x)`) are likewise unsupported in AOT (`codegen: unsupported call "f"`)
  — the L6.6 Callable surface is therefore checker-only for now.

## New work — modern 2026 language-design roadmap

These are *new* phases layered on top of the existing DONE work. Each item is
a first-class roadmap entry with an ADR, a unit test, and an `integration/`
program where relevant. Order reflects dependency: front-end (lexer/parser)
first, then semantics/type system, then runtime, then codegen, then tooling.

### Phase 4 — lexer modernization (2026)

**Goal: a resilient, position-rich lexer that supports a modern source surface.**

- **L4.1 Error-recovering lexer** — on an unexpected character, emit a
  `TokError` token carrying the span + message and *resume*, instead of
  aborting the whole file. The parser/semantic can then report multiple
  diagnostics per run (feed the LSP).
- **L4.2 Rich token spans** — each token carries `start` AND `end` (byte +
  rune offsets), plus an optional multi-line flag, so f-strings, slices, and
  `match` patterns have exact ranges for hover/diagnostics/formatting.
- **L4.3 Unicode identifiers** — accept the full `XID_Start`/`XID_Continue`
  classes (not just ASCII), with NFC normalization + a clear diagnostic for
  confusables (e.g. `l` vs `1`, `Ο` vs `O`). ✅ DONE — lexer now decodes UTF-8
  runes and scans identifiers by Unicode `ID_Start`/`ID_Continue` categories
  (letters + Nl + Other_ID_Start additions for start; plus marks, digits,
  connector punctuation, and Other_ID_Continue for continuation), NFC-normalizes
  identifier text via `golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm` (so decomposed and
  precomposed spellings are one symbol), and emits a `TokWarning` →
  `LevelWarning` diagnostic for Greek/Cyrillic homoglyph lookalikes (e.g.
  `Ο` U+039F vs Latin `O`). ASCII-start identifiers may continue through
  multi-byte runes (e.g. `café`). Added `TokWarning` token kind; parser
  collects warnings into `prog.Diags` for the CLI/LSP warning path.
- **L4.4 Numeric-literal modernization** — `0xFF` hex, `0b101` binary,
  `0o17` octal, and `1_000`/`0x_FF` digit-group separators; keep exact
  integer semantics, reject `_` misuse. ✅ DONE (ADR 0153)
- **L4.5 Raw strings + triple-quoted strings** — `r"..."`/`R'...'` raw strings (no escape processing; a `\` before a quote keeps the string open) and `"""..."""`/`'''...'''` triple-quoted strings (may span lines); raw-triple `r"""..."""`; docstring extraction reuses both forms; formatter preserves raw/triple forms. — ✅ DONE
- **L4.6 Line continuation** — trailing `\` at end of line joins the next
  physical line into one logical line (Python-compatible), so long call
  argument lists don't force parens. — ✅ DONE (lexer skips the continued
  line's leading indentation and blank/comment-only continuation lines;
  unit + integration tests)
- **L4.7 Token-stream cursor API** — a small cursor/`peek(n)`/`mark()`
  abstraction shared by parser, formatter, and LSP so all three walk the same
  stream (single source of truth for spans). ✅ DONE — `Cursor` in
  `pkg/lang/token.go` with bounds-safe `peek(n)`, `next()`, `mark()`/`reset()`,
  `position()`, and `atEOF`/`atNewline`/`atDedent`/`atIndent`/`skipNewlines`;
  the parser now walks the shared cursor (its `toks`/`pos` are gone), so the
  token stream and spans are a single source of truth; unit tests in
  `pkg/lang/cursor_test.go` (lookahead, mark/reset backtracking, EOF safety,
  predicates).

### Phase 5 — parser modernization (2026)

**Goal: a fast, error-tolerant Pratt parser with a modern syntax surface.**

- **L5.1 Pratt / precedence-climbing parser** ✅ DONE — `parseExprPrec` in
  `pkg/lang/parser.go` is a precedence-climbing loop over a `prec` table (unary,
  `**` right-assoc, multiplicative, additive, comparison, `and`/`or`, ternary);
  new operators are one table entry + one `binaryOp` case. Covered by
  `pkg/lang/parser_pratt_test.go` (associativity + precedence rendering).
- **L5.2 Panic-mode error recovery** — on a parse error, skip to the next
  statement/block boundary and keep parsing, producing a forest of
  `ParseError`s (not just the first). Feeds the LSP + `gusty check`. ✅ DONE
  — `parseProgram` collects a forest of `*ParseError`s via `recoverStmt()`
  (nest-aware INDENT/DEDENT skipping), returns a partial AST plus an
  aggregate `*ParseErrors`; the LSP reports each error as a separate
  diagnostic and still indexes the partial program; `gusty check`/`verify`
  print the whole forest.
- **L5.3 Trailing commas** — allow `f(a, b,)`, `[1, 2,]`, `{1: 2,}` and
  `match` case arg lists, for clean diffs and formatter round-trips.
  ✅ DONE — call args, list/dict/set literals, tuples (incl. `(a,)` 1-tuple),
  and match class-pattern arg lists all tolerate a trailing comma; the
  canonical formatter normalizes them away and its output re-parses cleanly.
  Covered by `pkg/lang/trailing_comma_test.go`.
- **L5.4 ✅ DONE — Walrus operator (`:=`)** — assignment expressions usable inside `if`
  conditions and comprehensions (`if (n := len(x)) > 0:`); scope rules per
  Python 3.8+.
- **L5.5 ✅ DONE — Union-type syntax `int | str`** — parse `|` in annotation position
  (and in `match` patterns) as a union type, not a bitwise-or; feed the
  gradual type checker.
- **L5.6 `async`/`await` + effectful syntax** ✅ DONE (this round) — parse `async def`,
  `await expr`, `async for`, `async with` as first-class syntax. `async`/`await` are lexed keywords; `async` sets the `Async` flag on
  `FuncDef`/`ForStmt`/`WithStmt`; `await e` reduces to `e` under the minimal synchronous-coroutine model (no suspension
  primitives yet), so both the interpreter and the AOT/JIT backend run async programs identically to their sync
  counterparts (conformance parity `async_basic.gy`). The cooperative event-loop runtime (coroutines, async protocols,
  a first-class `AwaitExpr`) is Phase 7 (L7.1).
- **L5.7 Type aliases `type X = ...`** ✅ DONE (this round) — parse alias declarations into a `TypeAliasStmt`; the type checker resolves references structurally (not nominal) by default via parse-time substitution of a structural copy. Aliases are compile-time no-ops in the interpreter/codegen/formatter; conformance case `typealias.gy`, ADR 0159, and unit tests.
- **L5.8 Incremental parse** — a stable parse tree keyed by spans so the LSP
  and REPL can re-parse only edited ranges (feeds incremental JIT in Phase 9).

### Phase 6 — semantics & type-system growth (2026)

**Goal: move `semantic.go` from static checks toward a real gradual checker.**

- **L6.1 Exhaustiveness checking for `match`** ✅ DONE — prove a `match` covers all
  subject shapes (int ranges, unions, wildcard); warn on non-exhaustive;
  this is the semantic half of Gap B.
- **L6.2 Definite-assignment analysis** ✅ DONE — warn which names are definitely
  assigned on every path through `if`/`match`/`try`; warn on possibly-unbound
  reads (mypy-style) before codegen.
- **L6.3 Union types** (`int | str`, `None | int` sugar for `Optional`) —
  infer/check unions through assignment + call boundaries; AOT widens to a
  tagged union layout. ✅ DONE (semantic inference: ternary widening +
  union-aware arithmetic, ADR 0158). ✅ DONE (runtime: union-annotated variables — `int | str`, `int | float` — are accepted and evaluated by the interpreter; `checkAnnot` accepts any union member; conformance + IR tests added). ✅ DONE (AOT tagged-union lowering: union-annotated scalar variables (`int | float`, `int | str`) get a tagged `%unionbox` slot; assignment stores the runtime member tag (0=int, 1=float, 2=str); print dispatches on the tag to emit `%d`/`%f`/`%s`, so an int member prints as `%d` and a float member as `%f` even after cross-member reassignment under branches/loops).
- L6.4 Literal types — `Literal[1, 2]` so `match` on constants enables exhaustiveness + narrowing; feed L6.1. ✅ DONE (this round)
- **L6.5 Type narrowing / refinement** — after `if isinstance(x, int):`, the
  checker narrows `x` from `any` to `int`; after `match case 1:`, narrows to
  literal `1`. Drives better AOT layout (Gap A). ✅ DONE — static isinstance-if
  narrowing (then/else branches, `not` flip, union complement via `dropType`)
  is implemented in the semantic checker (`narrowFromCond`/`analyzeNarrowed`)
  and unit-tested (`TestNarrowIsInstanceThen/Else/Not`). Match-literal narrowing
  to `Literal[1]` was already present (L6.4).
- **L6.6 Variance + generics** ✅ DONE (ADR 0160) — one structural subtyping
  relation (`subType` in `pkg/lang/variance.go`) implements a declared variance
  table: `list[T]`/`set[T]`/`dict[K, V]` **invariant** (writable containers),
  `Sequence[T]`/`iter[T]`/`tuple[...]` **covariant** (read-only, element type may
  widen, arity fixed), `Callable[[P...], R]` **contravariant** in parameters +
  covariant return, user classes **nominal** over the declared base chain
  (`ClassIndex`, filled by a statement-tree pre-pass so annotations may name a
  class before its declaration). Protocol structural subtyping covers
  `Sequence`/`Callable`; a *freshly built* container literal is checked
  covariantly (`x: list[int | str] = [1]` is accepted, `x: list[int] = ["a"]` is
  not). `gusty check` **reports contravariant misuse** (and every other rule)
  with a stable `Diagnostic.Code` (`type.variance.invariant` /
  `.covariant` / `.contravariant` / `.nominal`, `type.callable.arity`,
  `type.union.members`) plus an actionable `Suggestion`; `gustyc --variance`
  prints the machine-readable table and `--schema` declares the `diagnostic` /
  `varianceRule` shapes. Function symbols now carry their declared parameter
  annotations (`TFunc(annots, ret)`), which is what makes contravariant
  substitution observable. Unit tests: `pkg/lang/variance_test.go`; parity +
  machine path: `integration/variance_check_test.go`, `programs/variance.gy`.
- **L6.7 Call-graph + reachability** ✅ DONE — compute a module call graph so
  dead-global elimination (`opt.go`) is precise and `__doc__` folding is
  reachable-driven.

### Phase 7 — runtime: concurrency, effects, precise GC (2026)

**Goal: a deterministic async core + memory-safety hardening.**

- **L7.1 Async runtime (`async`/`await`)** ✅ DONE — cooperative async in the
  interpreter: `async def` returns a *coroutine object* (deferred thunk; the
  body does not run at call time), `await` runs it to completion (deterministic,
  race-free), and `async for` awaits each coroutine element. AOT keeps eager
  semantics; parity holds because awaited async calls run once to completion in
  both backends (codegen `await` evaluates its operand). `async with` remains
  eager (`__enter__`/`__exit__`); mid-body suspension and `__aenter__`/`__aexit__`
  protocols are future work.
- **L7.2 Precise stack roots** — replace conservative mark-and-sweep with
  precise rooting: the GC knows exactly which stack slots/registers hold
  handles (fixes Gap A's instance-layout bug at the root cause).
- **L7.3 Tagged pointers / NaN-boxing** — box small ints and floats in the
  payload so `int`/`float`/`bool` avoid heap allocation; pairs with L7.2 for
  a compact, allocation-free fast path.
- **L7.4 Refcount + cycle-collect hybrid** — refcount for acyclic data (fast
  reclaim), tracing collector for cycles; deterministic pause for the AOT
  path.
- **L7.5 Algebraic effects** — a `raise`/`yield`/`await` effect system as a
  first-class control-flow model in codegen, unifying exceptions, generators,
  and async (one lowering, one runtime).
- **L7.6 Effect/async exhaustiveness** — the semantic check proves an
  `async def`'s control flow always terminates (no missing `await`/`return`).

### Phase 8 — codegen: monomorphization, verification, autovectorization (2026)

**Goal: make AOT a first-class optimized backend.**

- **L8.1 Generic monomorphization** — instantiate `list[T]`/`dict[K,V]` per
  concrete type at compile time (no runtime generics), enabling scalar
  replacement (Gap H) and boxing elimination (L7.3).
- **L8.2 `verifyModule`-driven pipeline** — ✅ DONE (ADR 0164). Verification is a
  pipeline stage, not a side effect of linking: `VerifyModuleIR` runs
  `opt -passes=verify` (plus the requested `-O` pipeline, following `--opt-level`)
  and falls back to `llc -filetype=null` when `opt` is absent. `Build` verifies the
  module it is about to link and carries the verdict in `BuildResult.verification`;
  `gustyc --verify-llvm <src>` exposes it (human line, or `--json` →
  `irVerification`: `ok`/`tool`/`skipped`/`pipeline`/`errors`/`note`/`toolchain`),
  with `--no-verify` to opt out. A missing toolchain is `skipped`, never `ok`.
  Finding: switching this on inside `Build` immediately exposed three container
  codegen bugs (Gap I.3, ADR 0163) that no test could see.
- **L8.3 Autovectorization** — annotate loop/array IR so LLVM vectorizes hot
  numeric loops; add a `--report=vector` output showing which loops vectorize.
- **L8.4 SROA/scalar-replacement** — promote non-escaping heap objects to
  registers (the Gap H follow-on), now driven by monomorphization (L8.1).
- **L8.5 Debug line tables in IR** — emit `!dbg` records from `sourcemap.go`
  spans so DWARF (already wired via `cc -g`) shows exact source lines.

### Phase 9 — tooling: incremental JIT, package manager, richer LSP (2026)

**Goal: a modern developer loop.**

- **L9.1 Incremental JIT REPL** — recompile only edited ranges (L5.8) through
  the LLVM JIT; hot loop retains registers across edits; `--repl` mode.
- **L9.2 Package manager (`gusty install`/`publish`)** — a module registry for
  on-disk stdlib + user packages; `extern fn` + FFI bindings per package;
  reproducible lockfile.
- **L9.3 Incremental build cache** — key module IR/objects by source hash +
  dependency graph (L6.7); only rebuild dirty subgraphs (`gusty build --cache`).
- **L9.4 Richer LSP** — go-to-definition, find-references, rename, hover type
  display (uses L6.3/L6.5 narrowing), inline error squiggles from the
  error-recovering lexer/parser (L4.1/L5.2).
- **L9.5 Formatting on save** — `gusty fmt` as an LSP `textDocument/format`
  provider, round-tripping f-strings, trailing commas (L5.3), and docstrings.
- **L9.6 Fuzz/parity CI** — extend `proptest.go` to differential-test the
  lexer/parser (parse → format → reparse) and both backends on the new
  surface (unions, async, walrus), seeded + deterministic.

### Phase 10 — cross-cutting: targets, ABI, portability (2026)

**Goal: Pyre runs anywhere.**

- **L10.1 WASM target** — lower AOT to WebAssembly via LLVM; `gusty --target=wasm`
  for browser/edge runtimes; the scheduler (L7.1) maps to `wasm` event loop.
- **L10.2 ABI stability** — a versioned, documented C ABI for `extern fn` exports (stable struct layout for unions/tagged values across releases). ✅ DONE (Round 2)
  exports (stable struct layout for unions/tagged values across releases).
- **L10.3 Shared-library export** — `gustyc --build <out> --shared` emits a
  position-independent `.so`/`.dylib` with the stable ABI (`BuildShared`,
  `cc -shared -fPIC`; object already PIC via `llc -relocation-model=pic`;
  versioned ABI marker carried, so extern exports stay stable across
  `dlopen`/loads). ✅ DONE (Round 3)
- **L10.4 Benchmark harness** ✅ DONE — `gustyc --bench-suite` measures a corpus
  (built-in, or every `*.gy` in `--bench-dir`, so the `integration/` parity
  programs become benchmark cases) on both execution backends and emits a
  versioned JSON artifact; `--bench-baseline` gates a run against a saved
  baseline (best-of-N on the AOT leg, tolerance + noise floor, per-regression
  `suggestion`) so a slowdown surfaces as a number with its own exit code (5).
  See ADR 0162, `docs/benchmark.md`.

## Definition of done per item

An item is done when it ships:

- A unit test in `pkg/lang/` exercising the behavior.
- An `integration/` whole-program compile-and-run case where applicable,
  asserting interpreter/AOT/JIT parity (byte-identical stdout).
- A `docs/adr/` entry for any non-obvious decision (or a renumbering of an
  existing ADR, e.g. `0152` renumbered from the duplicated `0143`).
- An update to `docs/language.md` and `docs/operations.md` when it changes
  user-visible syntax or CLI flags.

## Definition of done for gap-shaped work
A gap is closed when the previously interpreter-only path also lowers on AOT
(or a new feature's both-backend parity program passes), and no
`interpreter-only`/`not lowered` comment remains in `codegen.go` for it.

## Sequencing note
Gaps A–H are the *current* next work (they unblock modern features). The 2026
phases (4–10) are layered on top: lexer/parser modernization (4–5) is
front-end work that can start in parallel with Gap D–H; semantics (6) and
runtime (7) build on Gap A–B; codegen (8) builds on Gap H.

## Gap J — found while closing earlier gaps (2026-09-27)

Surfaced by the L8.2 module verifier and by writing both-backend print coverage.
Each is a concrete, reproducible defect with the shape to fix it.

- **Gap J.1 — multi-argument `print` separator** — ✅ DONE (ADR 0165).
  `print` is now Python's `print(*args, sep=" ", end="\n")` in both backends:
  `print("a =", 1)` writes `a = 1` (it used to write `a =` and `1` on separate lines,
  which parity could never see because both backends did it). `sep`/`end` are honoured
  for every argument kind — the runtime container printers (`rt_print_list`,
  `rt_dict_print`, `rt_set_print`) take the newline as a flag instead of baking it into
  the format — a `%` in `sep` is literal text, `print()` writes a blank line, and an
  argument that prints during its own evaluation interleaves identically per backend.
  Non-constant `sep`/`end` in AOT is an actionable diagnostic, not bad IR. Goldens were
  regenerated with the new `go test ./integration -run TestCLIBuild -args -update` path,
  and `programs/print_args.gy` joins the conformance corpus.
- **Gap J.2 — set/dict comprehension assignment (AOT)** — 🟨 PARTIAL.
  Fixed by ADR 0165: the interpreter now renders a set as `{1, 2}` (and `set()` when
  empty) instead of `<set>`, matching `rt_set_print`, so a set prints the same on both
  backends. Still open: `sa = {x for x in [3, 1, 2]}` / `da = {k: k * 2 for k in [1, 2]}`
  at module scope do not lower (`len of a non-string variable` for the dict case) — needs
  the ADR 0163 binding rule extended to set and dict comprehensions. `{x for x in [...]
  if ...}` is also a parser gap today (it parses the `if` as a conditional expression and
  demands `else`).
- **Gap J.3 — the exit-code table is aspirational** — 🟥 FOUND.
  `docs/operations.md` documents `3 = runtime error` and `4 = usage error`, but the CLI
  never emits either: usage, parse and front-end failures all return `2`, and a program
  that traps still exits `1`. Fix by implementing the contract (runtime failures exit 3)
  or by documenting the truth; agents currently cannot branch on "the program crashed"
  separately from "the compiler failed".
- **Gap J.4 — `opt` fallback is silent** — 🟥 FOUND.
  `OptimizeIR` runs the real `opt` pipeline and, on any failure (tool missing, IR
  rejected), returns the unoptimised module with no signal — a machine cannot tell
  "optimised at -O2" from "the optimiser was unavailable". Verification now checks
  whatever ships, but the pipeline should report whether the real passes ran (a field on
  the build/emit result plus a warning), so `--opt-level=2` never quietly means `-O0`.
- **Gap J.5 — string arguments to user functions (AOT)** — 🟨 PARTIAL.
  `def shout(msg): ...` called as `shout("hi")` emitted `call i32 @shout(i32 @.str1)`,
  which LLVM rejects (`global variable reference must have pointer type`). Codegen now
  refuses it up front with a message naming the parameter —
  `strings are not supported as function arguments in the AOT backend yet (parameter
  "name" of greet); the interpreter supports them` — so the failure is a compile
  diagnostic an agent can match (documented in `docs/operations.md` § Codegen
  capability messages) instead of IR that only the L8.2 verifier would notice. Covered
  by `pkg/lang/string_args_test.go` + `integration/string_args_test.go`.
  Still open: the real fix, which is the same string representation Gap I.2 needs —
  string-typed parameters (annotation/defaults/call sites, like the container-kind
  inference in `heapargs.go`), an `i8*` slot in the callee, and runtime helpers for
  print/strlen/compare, with the unsupported uses reported as diagnostics.

## Gap K — truthiness (found writing the L9.6 corpus, 2026-09-27)

- **Gap K.1 — truthiness was wrong or uncompilable on both backends** — ✅ DONE (ADR 0167).
  `if count:` (an integer condition) failed to compile at all — the backend fed an `i32`
  to `br i1` — and `if a and b:`, `if a < b or b > 9:`, `while total:`, `print(not x)`,
  `1 if x else 2` and `elif <int>:` all failed the same way, because a condition operand
  was assumed to be an `i32` while comparisons produce an `i1`. On the other side,
  `if 0.0:` was *true* in the interpreter (a float is a handle, and a handle is nonzero),
  and in AOT a non-empty list or dict was *false* (`if xs:` tested the handle word). Now:
  conditions normalise `i1`/`i32` through one helper (`truthOperand`, also used by `elif`,
  `and`/`or`, `not`, the ternary and membership results), containers and strings test
  their length (`rt_list_len`/`rt_dict_len`/`rt_set_len`, or the compile-time length of a
  literal), boolean operators yield the interpreter's `i32` 0/1, and the interpreter asks
  the heap object behind a handle (`Evaluator.truthy`) at every condition site — `if`,
  `elif`, `while`, `and`/`or`, `not`, ternary, comprehension filters and `match` guards.
  Covered by `integration/truthiness_test.go` (38 cases checked against Python's answer on
  both backends + module verification) and `programs/truthiness.gy` in the conformance
  corpus.
  **Found on the way and fixed in the same change:** rebinding a container variable freed
  its previous handle unconditionally, and `0` — the value of a raw int/bool/None and of a
  freshly declared container — is also a legal heap slot index, so `ys = []` recycled
  slot 0 out from under an unrelated list (observed as `xs = [i for i in range(3)]` later
  reading as empty). Every free is now guarded (`if (h != 0) rt_free(h)`), pinned by
  `TestEmptyBindingNeverFreesHandleZero`.
- **Gap K.2 — `for k in d:` over a dict yields nothing in AOT** — ✅ DONE.
  `d = {1: 2, 3: 4}` / `for k in d: print(k)` printed the keys on the interpreter and
  nothing in the native binary, with no error: the loop compared its index against the
  dict's *handle* instead of its length. Container iteration now asks the runtime
  (`rt_list_len`/`rt_dict_len`/`rt_set_len`), a dict yields its keys from the `[key,
  value]` pair layout (entry i's key at `2*i`), and a container returned by a call is
  registered from the checker's inferred type so `d = make(3)` iterates too. Fixed
  alongside it: the checker bound a `for` variable to the *iterable's* type (so
  `for k in d: s = s + k` was rejected as `int + dict[any, any]`), and the loop
  variable's slot was allocated inside the body block, which does not dominate the code
  after the loop — two loops reusing one name (`for k in d:` … `for k in m:`) failed the
  verifier with "Instruction does not dominate all uses". Covered by
  `integration/dict_iteration_test.go` (17 cases × both backends vs Python) and
  `programs/subscript_assign.gy`.
- **Gap K.4 — item assignment was silently dropped by the parser** — ✅ DONE.
  `d[1] = 2` parsed "successfully": `parseExprOrAssign` consumed `= 2` and returned an
  expression statement, so the assignment vanished — on both backends, with no
  diagnostic (`1 = 2` and `f() = 1` likewise produced *zero* statements, because the
  statement-recovery loop in `parseTopLevel` only recorded `*ParseError`s and threw away
  every other parser failure). Now: `d[k] = v` inserts/updates a dict, `xs[i] = v`
  replaces an element and raises `IndexError` out of bounds (a bounds test around the
  store in AOT, via the new `rt_put_elem` which writes without bumping the length),
  sets and strings reject it, and an unassignable target is a real parse error —
  including any non-`ParseError` the parser raises, which can no longer disappear.
  Covered by `pkg/lang/subscript_assign_test.go` (AST shape, parse errors, interpreter
  semantics, IR shape + verification, actionable diagnostics) and
  `integration/programs/subscript_assign.gy`.
- **Gap K.5 — `{}` was a set in the interpreter and a dict in AOT** — ✅ DONE.
  Python's `{}` is an empty dict; the parser's brace classifier fell through to `SetLit`
  when there were no elements, so `d = {}` then `d[k] = v` failed with `not in set` on
  the interpreter while the AOT emitted dict code for the same source. `{}` now parses to
  an empty `DictLit` (`{1, 2}` is still a set), pinned by `TestEmptyBracesIsAnEmptyDict`.
- **Gap K.6 — unhandled exceptions reported nothing in AOT** — ✅ DONE.
  `xs = [1]` / `xs[5] = 2` raised on the interpreter and exited 1, while the AOT binary
  took the raise-exit path and exited **0 printing nothing**: to a script, a trapped
  program had succeeded. Four defects were underneath it:
  - the raise-exit block was `ret i32 0`, and there was no message global beside
    `@exn_code`, so the raise path *could not* say what it was reporting. Now `@exn_msg`
    travels with the flag (`rt_die` writes a traceback header + `IndexError: index out of
    range` to fd 2 via `write`, and main returns 1). The block is emitted only for
    programs that can raise, so clean programs' IR is byte-identical.
  - the checker's `exceptions` map was **declared but never populated**, so
    `raise ValueError("boom")` was a valid interpreter program that failed AOT
    compilation with `undefined name "ValueError"`. The class list, its codes, and the
    checker's name table now come from one place (`pkg/lang/exceptions.go`), and a class
    derived from an exception is itself raisable.
  - **runtime errors were not exceptions** in the interpreter: an out-of-range read or
    write aborted instead of unwinding, so `except IndexError:` never ran (AOT caught it,
    the interpreter did not — an inversion worth remembering). Reads are now checked too:
    the AOT used to load whatever sat at the slot and print `0` for `xs[5]` / `d[missing]`;
    they raise `IndexError` / `KeyError` via `checkIndexRead` / `checkKeyRead`.
  - the interpreter printed its traceback to **stdout**, mixing diagnostics with program
    output; both backends now use stderr, and the report names the class
    (`ValueError: boom`), matching Python's last line.
  Found while fixing this: **`rt_dict_has` scanned `i < count` while walking the flat
  [key, value] array two words at a time**, so only the first ⌈count/2⌉ keys were ever
  found — `3 in {1: 2, 3: 4}` was false in compiled binaries and `d[k]` for a later key
  raised KeyError. It was invisible because nothing ever asked a compiled program about a
  dict's later keys. Covered by `integration/uncaught_exception_test.go` (reports, exit
  codes, clean stdout, catchability on both backends, statically-impossible assignments)
  plus new membership cases in `integration/dict_iteration_test.go`.
- **Gap K.8 — AOT tracebacks have no source location** — ⏳ PLANNED.
  The compiled report prints the exception line but no `File "prog", line N, in fn` frame,
  so the two backends' reports differ whenever `--debug` is off. Fix by emitting DWARF
  line tables (L8.5) and having the raise sites carry a source span in `@exn_msg`.
- **Gap K.7 — `--build` could fail with no stated reason** — ✅ DONE. The error branch
  printed the diagnostics *or* the failure line, never both, so a build that died in
  codegen while the program also carried warnings exited 1 showing only warnings; and the
  failure paths in `Build` returned no result at all for codegen/`llc`/source-map errors,
  so `--json` lost the diagnostics too. Now every failure path returns the partial
  `BuildResult` (diagnostics, IR, verification) and the CLI always prints the reason:
  `warning at 1:7: …` then `gustyc: build: codegen: unsupported call "enumerate"`, exit 1
  (the stage prefix is no longer doubled either). Contract documented in
  `docs/operations.md` § Failure output contract; pinned by
  `TestCLIBuildFailureStatesItsReason` and `TestCLIBuildFailureJSONCarriesDiagnosticsOnFailure`.
  The gap was found by a build that failed this way and said nothing.
- **Gap K.3 — `list.pop` and the `set()` constructor are missing** — 🟥 FOUND.
  `xs.pop()` is `no such list method pop` in the interpreter and unsupported in AOT, so
  the natural way to empty a container in a `while xs:` loop does not exist (the
  truthiness tests have to rebind to `[]` instead); `set()` fails as
  `unsupported call for eval` although `{1, 2}` literals and the `set` annotation work.
  Both are ordinary Python that the language claims to support — implement in the
  interpreter first, then mirror in codegen, with a conformance program per ADR 0165/0167.
